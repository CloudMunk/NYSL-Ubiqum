                    <p >
                        The Northside Youth Soccer League was established in 1996
                        to provide athletes residing in Chicago's northside an environment
                        in which to learn and play soccer. To be a member of NYSL, you must be
                        between the ages of 4-12 and reside in a Chicago northside neighborhood. NYSL
                        is ran  by a small full-time staff, and relies on the generous volunteer time
                        of parents and previous league members.
